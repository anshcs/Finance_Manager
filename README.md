# Finance_Manager

### I have developed a personal finance management application that utilizes SQL as a back-end for the storage of monthly bank statements. The application performs data cleaning and adds the processed information to the database. Additionally, the application employs web scraping techniques to gather news headlines and leverages a BERT (NLP) model to conduct sentiment analysis on current stock market trends, thus providing investment suggestions.
